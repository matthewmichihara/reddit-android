Reddit for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthewmichihara/reddit-android.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthewmichihara/reddit-android)
==================
An extremely limited, barebones, incomplete Reddit client. There are
just so many things it does not do.

However, you can:
* View the front page in a predetermined sort order.
* View an expandable/collapsible comment tree for most comments.
* Visit a URL of a front page story.
* View upvotes and a few other bits of listing metadata.
* Pull to refresh.
* Infinitely scroll through posts.

No support for:
* Logging in.
* Posting comments.
* Sorting listings/comments.
* Upvoting/downvoting.
* Viewing a particular subreddit.
* Many, many other things you'd probably expect it to be able to do.
